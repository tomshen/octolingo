Octolingo
=========

**Octolingo** is a Google Hangouts app for live speech translation. It takes your in speech in any of eight languages and speaks it in whatever your chat partners have set as their language of choice. It also provides a fully translated transcript of your conversation.

It is peer to peer and language independent, so any number of members can chat with any number of members that speak any of the eight languages. Because it's integrated with Google Hangouts, a platform that people already use and trust, Octolingo is a convenient way to keep up with colleagues, research partners, and friends around the globe.
